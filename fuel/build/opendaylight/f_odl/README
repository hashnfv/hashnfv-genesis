      odl.pp

Makefile:
Invoked by the git root Makefile, it builds the odl debian package from the
debian pkg source directory (inside this directory) and pushes it together
with the manifests to the fuel build source artifact directory, such that it
eventually gets built into the new fuel .iso

odl.pp:
Controls the installation and configuration of odl

odl deb pkg src:
Is the debian package source directory tree including all needed odl artifacts
and debian pakage meta data. This debian source package tree is built from
fuel-build/opendaylight and doesnt exist before it has bee built.
