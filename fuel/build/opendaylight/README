This directory builds the OpenDaylight debian package by cloning the
opendaylight.org repo, building the odl tag specified in
"fuel-build/config-spec" and constructing a debian package source tree under
"f_odl", which automatically is linked into "fuel_build/." for further build processing.

The opendaylight has the following structure:
.
+--------+-------------+-----------+
|        |             |           |
|     Makefile  make-odl-deb.sh  README
|                              (this file)
|
+----------+----------+
           |          |
       odl_maven/   f_odl/

Makefile:
Invoked by the git root Makefile, it builds the clones the odl repo from
odl, checkout the tag/branch indicated in "fuelbuild/config-spec", builds
odl, and calls "make-odl-deb.sh" to create a debian package source tree.

make-odl-deb.sh:
Creates the odl debian package source tree in "f_odl" from the odl build
results.

odl_maven/:
Contains needed control files for maven OpenDaylight build

f_odl/:
Contains buildscripts and the generated odl debian package source tree produced
by the odl build (make-odl-deb.sh) which is later used by the root build system.

NOTE on the controller/ git repo clone:
The git controller repo clone Contains all artifacts from the odl build, it only
exists in /tmp inside the build docker container and is not visible anywhere on
the build host

Note on build caching:
The latest build results are cached, and will not be rebuilt unless the fuel-build/
config-spec is changed in respect to odl version or if make clean is applied.
./.odl-build.log and ./.odl-build.history are used to keep adequate bookmaking to
track caching and needed cleanout.
