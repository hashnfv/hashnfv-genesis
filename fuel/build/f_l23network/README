Addition to add entries to /etc/hosts through Astute.

The astute.yaml file should contain entries as those below to have them picked up during deployment:

opnfv:
  hosts:
  - name: test1
    address: 192.168.100.100
    fqdn: test1.opnfv.org
  - name: test2
    address: 192.168.100.101
    fqdn: test2.opnfv.org
  - name: test3
    address: 192.168.100.102
    fqdn: test3.opnfv.org

The suggested method for adding this information is to prepare for deployment with the Fuel GUI or CLI,
but before actually deploying:

1. Download the current deployment for all hosts: fuel --env 1 deployment --default
2. Iterate through the hosts in "deployment_1" and add hosts configuration in the above format to their
   respective yaml file.
3. Upload the modifed deployment information: fuel --env 1 deployment --upload

After deploying, the additions will be included in /etc/astute.yaml of each host.
