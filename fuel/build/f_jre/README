This directory adds the openjdk-8-jre Java package and related puppet
deployment manifest such that it gets built into the .iso image an deployed
on the stack controller cluster.

The f_jre has the following structure:
.
+--------+----------+-----------+
         |          |           |
      puppet/    Makefile     README
         |                  (this file)
         |
         |
      modules/
         |
         |
         |
       opnfv/
         |

         |
     manifests/
         |
         |
         |
      jre.pp

Makefile:
Invoked by the git root Makefile, it pulls the openjdk-8-jre deb package
from a propper mirror and pushes i together with the manifests to a fuel
build artifact directory, such that it eventually gets built into the new
fuel .iso

jre.pp:
Controls the installation and configuration of java
