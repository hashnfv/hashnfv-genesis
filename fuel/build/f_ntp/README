Addition to add ntp.conf separately for compute hosts and controller hosts through Astute.

The astute.yaml file should contain entries as those below to have them picked up during deployment:

opnfv:
  ntp:
    controller: |
     line 1
     line 2
   compute: |
     line 1
     line 2

The suggested method for adding this information is to prepare for deployment with the Fuel GUI or CLI,
but before actually deploying:

1. Download the current deployment for all hosts: fuel --env 1 deployment --default
2. Iterate through the hosts in "deployment_1" and add hosts configuration in the above format to their
   respective yaml file.
3. Upload the modifed deployment information: fuel --env 1 deployment --upload

After deploying, the additions will be included in /etc/astute.yaml of each host.
