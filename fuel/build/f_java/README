deployment manifest such that it gets built into the .iso image an deployed
on the stack controller cluster.

         |          |           |
      puppet/    Makefile     README

      java.pp

Makefile:
Invoked by the git root Makefile, it pulls the openjdk-8-jdk deb package
from a propper mirror and pushes i together with the manifests to a fuel
build artifact directory, such that it eventually gets built into the new
fuel .iso

java.pp:
Controls the installation and configuration of java
