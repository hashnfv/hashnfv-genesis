This patch introduces the following features and bug fixes:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1) The OpenDaylight SDN server - unplumbed (config.mk needs to be changed
   in order to enable it, see: fuel-build/DOC/BUILD/README.build)
2) cofig-spec - a way to configure the stack component versions
   to be built - see the fuel-build/config.mk file
3) A simplified Docker build startegy, pulling a pre-fabricated
   docker base image from the Internet

NOTE: Before you start building - you need to purge any previous
"opnfv.org/ubuntu-builder" docker image: "sudo docker rmi -f opnfv.org/ubuntu-builder
Double check that you dont have any remaining "opnfv.org/ubuntu-builder" images by
"docker images".
A new docker image will automatically be rebuilt in the build process.

Limitations and known issues:
-----------------------------
1) OpenDaylight is for now just sitting in the controllers, not plumbed to anything
   northbound or southbound.
2) OpenDaylight is currently only building with Oracle Java JDK, that is Oracle Java
   is used in the build process while OpenJava is used in the runtime environment.
   Read the licencing obligations in /fuel-build/LICENCE before you start building.
