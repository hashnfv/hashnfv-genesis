This is the start of the interactive frontend that will add OPNFV configuration into
the astute.yaml of the nodes. Currently just a test setup - prepare an installation
up to the point of "deploy changes", but run "./pre-deploy.sh <envid> fragment.yaml"
before actually hitting deploy, which will make sure to add the example fragment to
the nodes.

Note that the only part of the fragment.yaml that actually is acted on is the hosts
part at this time.
