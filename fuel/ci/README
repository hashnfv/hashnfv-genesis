The genesis/fuel/ci directory holds all Fuel@OPNFV abstractions for the OPNFV
community release and continous integration pipeline.
There are two Fuel@OPNF autonomous scripts fo this, complying to the OPNFV CI pipeline guideline:
 - build.sh
 - deploy.sh

For more info on usage:
./build.sh -h
./deploy.sh -h

To be able to deploy on a certain metal environment there needs to be a Deplyment Environment Adaptor" executable with propper added to $PATH such that
deploy.sh can call it by $dea [options] as indicated by ./deploy -h.
