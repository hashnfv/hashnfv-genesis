The structure is being reworked. This page describes the DEA interface.

The DEA API is internal to the deployer, but documented here for information.

*** DEA API definition version 1.1 ***

# Get the DEA API version supported by this adapter
dea_getApiVersion ()

# Node numbering is sequential.
# Get the role for this node
# Argument 1: node id
dea_getNodeRole()

# Get IP address of Fuel master
dea_getFuelIp()

# Get netmask Fuel master
dea_getFuelNetmask()

# Get gateway address of Fuel master
dea_getFuelGateway()

# Get gateway address of Fuel master
dea_getFuelHostname()

# Get DNS address of Fuel master
dea_getFuelDns()

# Convert a normal MAC to a Fuel short mac for --node-id
dea_convertMacToShortMac()

# Get property from DEA file
# Argument 1: search path, as e.g. "fuel ADMIN_NETWORK ipaddress"
dea_getProperty()

# Convert DHA node id to Fuel cluster node id
# Look for lowest Fuel node number, this will be DHA node 1
# Argument: node id
dea_getClusterNodeId()

# Entry point for dea functions
# Typically do not call "dea_node_zeroMBR" but "dea node_ZeroMBR"
# Before calling dea, the adapter file must gave been sourced with
# the DEA file name as argument
dea()
