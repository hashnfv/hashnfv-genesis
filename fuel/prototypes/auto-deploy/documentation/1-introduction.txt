The structure is being reworked. This page is an introduction to DEA
and DHA.

Introduction

The aim of the deployment prototype is to try out a (hopefully)
logical setup to support Fuel deployment on a variety of different
hardware platforms using a common data format to describe the
deployment itself and another data format to describe the hardware in
question.

DEA.yaml The DEA.yaml file describes a Fuel deployment, complete with
	all settings. The easiest way to create this file is to use
	the "create_templates.sh" script in an existing deployment to
	copy its configuration to the DEA.yaml file.

DHA.yaml The DHA.yaml file describes to hardware setup for an
	installation. This file denotes among other things which DHA
	adapter to use when deploying Fuel on this hardware setup.
	
DHA adapter interface: The DHA adapter interface contains a number of
    functions calls available to the automatic Fuel deployer script
    (deploy.sh). Each adapter creates an implementation of this
    interface in order for the deployer to orchestrate the
    installation. There's currently an example DHA adapter "libvirt"
    that is able to deploy Fuel in a nested KVM environment. Future
    adapters could support HP C7000, Dell R620 or other types of
    hardware.

    It is important to note that a certain DHA adapter could implement
    the dha_fuelCustomInstall() function, which for instance could
    install the Fuel master as a VM or using PXE.

A typical installation would be kicked off by the following command:

./deploy.sh <isofile to deploy> <dea.yaml> <dha.yaml>
