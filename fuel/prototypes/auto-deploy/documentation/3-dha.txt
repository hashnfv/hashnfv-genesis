The structure is being reworked. This page describes the DHA.yaml file.

Below is an example DHA for a libvirt deployment. An actual hardware deployment
could for instance add additional data fields to the node list, such as:

nodes:
- id: 1
  pxeMac: 52:54:00:9c:c2:c9
  ipmiIp: 192.168.220.1
  ipmiUser: admin
  impiPassword: ericsson
  isFuel: true

The important thing is to keep the mandatory fields and add additional
ones to map to the DHA adapter implementation for the hardware in
question.

The following example for libvirt is based on what's created by
create_template.sh.

Example DHA.yaml file for a libvirt adapter

# DHA API version supported

comment: Small libvirt deployment

# Adapter to use for this definition
adapter: libvirt

# Node list.
# Mandatory fields are id, role and the "isFuel: true" property
# for the Fuel node if not fuelCustomInstall is set, when it is
# optional.
# The MAC address of the PXE boot interface is not mandatory
#   to be set, but the field must be present.
# All other fields are adapter specific.

nodes:
- id: 1
  pxeMac: 52:54:00:38:c7:8e
- id: 2
  pxeMac: 52:54:00:9c:c2:c9
- id: 3
  pxeMac: 11:11:11:11:11:11
  isFuel: true

# Deployment power on strategy
# all:      Turn on all nodes at once. If MAC addresses are set these
#           will be used for connecting roles to physical nodes, if the
#           installation order will be arbitrary.
# sequence: Turn on the nodes in sequence starting with the lowest order
#           node and wait for the node to be detected by Fuel. Not until
#           the node has been detected and assigned a role will the next
#           node be turned on.
powerOnStrategy: all

# If fuelCustomInstall is set to true, Fuel is assumed to be installed by
# calling the DHA adapter function "dha_fuelCustomInstall()"  with two
# arguments: node ID and the ISO file name to deploy. The custom install
# function is then to handle all necessary logic to boot the Fuel master
# from the ISO and then return.
# Allowed values: true, false

fuelCustomInstall: false
